# Configure pnpm so it only installs package versions that have been published on the npm registry for at least 24 hours
# (1440 minutes). This helps mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks by avoiding newly published, potentially
# malicious versions. Keep this in sync with npm-check-updates's `cooldown` configuration.
